# Simple_Drag_n_Drop
This is a simple web application as my learning in web programming with JS+ReactJS

## Idea
There are two containers (let's say A and B) in the center of page side by side, and a container that contains sample (C). The container represent the label of sample. Container A and B is empty at first, and container C fills with samples that could be draged by user. The sample shall be labeled as the name of the container.
